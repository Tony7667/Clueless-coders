We are building a prototype software to help users trapped in a natural disaster guide them to safety.
This software consist of features like live location tracking, idendentification of critical and non-critical zones, AI powered chatbot, locations of nearby shelters and food supply and emergency contacts. 
We have also provided information related to several NGOs and person who are interested in donating to those in need can use our software as needed.
