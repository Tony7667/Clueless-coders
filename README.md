- We are building a prototype software to help users trapped in a natural disaster guide them to safety.
- This software consist of features like live location tracking, idendentification of critical and non-critical zones, AI powered chatbot, locations of nearby shelters and food supply and emergency contacts. 
- We have also provided information related to several NGOs and person who are interested in donating to those in need can use our software as needed.
